What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialise a repository, Git places a hidden directory called .git in the folder. 

The directory contains files that git needs to operate and keep track of my files.

I need to do it so that git will work. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is not tracked by git until they are added to the staging area. 

After I changed lesson_1_reflections.txt, I ran status again. Git noted that it had been modified. 

However, it did not notice that I had changed lesson_2_reflections.txt. 

Git advised me to re-add the file to update what will be committed. So I guess that if I don't, the version at the time of adding would be committed.

That makes me wonder what would happen to the changes I made in the interim.

I believe they would be lost. Notepad would probably ask me if I wanted to retain the file since it had been changed by another program.

Update: I was wrong. In git status, I see 'Changes not staged for commit:' and the same advice to add the file or checkout to discard changes.

The files in the staging area will be included in the next commit together.

The staging area allows me to group files so that any changes to them will be bundled into the same commit. 

If Caroline added all three files to her initial commit, then any future checkouts she made for the chili recipe would also affect the cake files.

I'm not sure yet whether initial adds and commits persist, so that those files are always bundled in that way.

I've always been confounded by the idea of the staging area. I want to go straight to 'commit.' This helped me see at least a little benefit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can run git diff or git diff --staged to see what changes are ready to be committed in the staging area, and make sure that they represent only one logical change.

However, I'm not sure what I would do if I'd already made more changes than that. Would it be better to revert changes, then re-add and commit, then go back to the file and redo my changes, assuming they are still in the undo history, rinse and repeat? Or just commit and list more than one change?
